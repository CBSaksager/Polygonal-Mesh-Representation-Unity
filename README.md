Polygon meshes are fundamental data structures in computer graphics, widely used to represent 3D surfaces. The aim of this project is to investigate alternatives to the half-edge data structure. Specifically, the project will focus on a vertex-centered approach inspired by rotation systems.

#### TODOs:
**Rotation System**
- [ ] Fix face split to avoid duplicates
    - [ ] Fix the temp solution to random selection of face
- [ ] Highlight selected face

**Half Edge**
- [x] Highlight selected face
- [x] Finish split face
    - [ ? ] Insert edges o_O
- [ ] Organize code files

**Overall**
- [ ] *Clear mesh* buttons needs to reset all data (right now not resetting selected face)
- [ ] Try added/importing other mesh structures/files
