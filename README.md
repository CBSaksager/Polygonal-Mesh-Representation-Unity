Polygon meshes are fundamental data structures in computer graphics, widely used to represent 3D surfaces. The aim of this project is to investigate alternatives to the half-edge data structure. Specifically, the project will focus on a vertex-centered approach inspired by rotation systems.

#### TODOs:
**Rotation System**
- Fix face split to avoid duplicates
- Highlight selected face

**Half Edge**
- Highlight selected face
- Finish split face
    - Insert edges o_O
